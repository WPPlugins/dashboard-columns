Easily change the number of dashboard columns from Screen Options.

## Description

The option to change the number of columns of the main WordPress Dashboard was removed in WordPress 3.8 in favor of a more dynamic/responsive approach. For most people, this change is great because it simplifies the UI. But for those who like more control over how their admin dashboard looks like this feels like a step backwards.

With the help of Dashboard Columns you can now easily change the number of columns in your admin dashboard. By selecting your preferred layout from the Screen Options menu you can now better customize the look and feel of your widgets. And all that without compromising the responsive UI:

- On large screens you have the option to choose between 1, 2, 3 or 4 columns
- On medium screens you have the option to choose between 1 or 2 columns
- On small screens everything is displayed using 1 column

3. Once you have found the plugin install it by clicking "Install Now"
4. Activate "Dashboard Columns" from the "Plugins" menu

### Manual Installation

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it on your server via SFTP. To do a manual install follow the steps below:

1. Download the plugin to your local computer
2. If downloaded as a zip archive extract it to your Desktop
3. Upload the plugin folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
